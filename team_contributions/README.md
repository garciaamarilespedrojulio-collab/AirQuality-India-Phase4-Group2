# Team Contributions

This folder contains evidence of individual and collective contributions made by the members of Group 2 for Phase 4 – Project Execution.

The purpose of this folder is to demonstrate collaborative work, as required by the learning guide and the course tutor. Files that may appear in this folder include:

- Screenshots of team discussions
- Notes or summaries from collaborative sessions
- Individual code snippets or mini-notebooks
- Contributions integrated from each team member
- Any additional evidence of participation

All materials here support the collaborative component of the project.
